# 👋 Hello!  

I'm **Javier Fernández**, a graduate in **Computer Engineering and Business Administration**.  
I'm passionate about **technology and software development**, and this repository showcases the projects I'm currently working on.  

Although my full-time job is not directly related to technology, **my goal is to transition into a software development career**.  
This space serves as a journal of my learning, experimentation, and growth, as I truly enjoy every step of the journey.  

I strongly believe that **technology drives the future**, and if it's both **useful and exciting**, why not be part of it?

## 🚀 Current Project: **Memories**  

In my free time, I'm developing **Memories**, an application that automates the drafting of **technical reports** using a **human-in-the-loop** approach.  
This project is an evolution of my Bachelor's Thesis,  
**["News Generation and Editing using GPT: Business Plan and Technological Development"](TenNews)**.  

### 🎯 **Project Goal**  
**Memories** aims to assist users in efficiently drafting technical documentation.  
The system allows users to:  

✔ **Attach documents** and extract key information.  
✔ **Scrape URLs** for relevant content.  
✔ **Interact with an agent-based system** to enhance technical writing.  

A **LangGraph-based agent** organizes the data and suggests content based on context.  

### 🏗️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript).  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask, LangChain, LangGraph).  
- **Database & Embeddings:** SQL and Pinecone.
